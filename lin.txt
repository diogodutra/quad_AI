#ArtificialIntelligence is being employed as #Autopilot for #Drones. One example is found at the end of this post.

In this example, the AI was trained by flying hundreds of simulated flights and considering the sequence of rewards that are as high as it is close to the commanded flight pattern. This environment with rewards allows the AI to evaluate the best actions for the predetermined task (ex: hover still at the target position).

This kind of algorithm is called #ReinforcementLearning. It is also called #DeepLearning since it counts with deep #NeuralNetworks for feedback training thanks to the #Keras framework.

The AI trend for robots and spacecrafts is becoming rapidly popular because creating #AutonomousVehicles with #MachineLearning is faster and cheaper than the traditional methodologies.

This project was approved by the @Udacity under the Machine Learning Nanodegree course and as the author I am really proud of it:
